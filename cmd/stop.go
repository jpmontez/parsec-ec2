var stopCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "stop",
	Short: "Stop a running EC2 instance",
	Long: `
Stops a Parsec EC2 instance created using the start command. Under the
hood this command runs 'terraform destroy', with removes all AWS resources
that are identified for creation in the terraform template.

This command depends on session information that is created by the start
command and stored in $HOME/.parsec-ec2/currentSession.json, so if this
has been manually modified or removed after running the start command,
the stop command will not execute. In this situation it is still possible
to manually run 'terraform destroy'. You will receive prompts for variable
values, but these can all be left blank with the exception of the region
variable, which can be set to the region the instances were started in.

Example:

parsec-ec2 stop
`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		currentSessionFile := fmt.Sprintf("%s/currentSession.json", appFolder)

		bytes, err := ioutil.ReadFile(currentSessionFile)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(`
No session information found.

If you think there may still be a running instance, you can try
'cd $HOME/.parsec-ec2 && terraform destroy', or alternatively
refer to the EC2 dashboard on the AWS website.`)
			os.Exit(1)
		}

		var currentSessionVars TfVars

		err = json.Unmarshal(bytes, &currentSessionVars)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			os.Exit(1)
		}

		err = os.Remove(currentSessionFile)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			os.Exit(1)
		}

		destroy := constructTerraformCommand(currentSessionVars, []string{"destroy", "-force"})

		err = executeTerraformCommandAndPrintOutput(destroy)
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Println(err)
			os.Exit(1)
		}

		fmt.Println(`
All AWS resources have been successfully terminated.`)
